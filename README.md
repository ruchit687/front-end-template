# web-templates
I am sharing few of my website templates, which I made while I was learning to play around with front-end using HTML and CSS. These templates are simple to understand, I haven't use bootstrap in any of them.
Each folder is a different project. 
Both HTML_code (structure) and CSS_codes (style-sheet) are in each folders, you can just clone or fork these folders and view them in your browser.
Everything is very simple and anyone with even basics of HTML and CSS can understand by just playing around with the code. 
I insist to edit the code as per your comfort and project and have a starting with your own projects.
I believe these templates will help you make your own webpages, blog, portfolios.

Thanks for visiting!!

Atlast, I request every front-end developer, UI/UX designer to contribute to this repository and make easy for more people to understand the basics of HTML and CSS.
