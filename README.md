# Website Templates
  Each Folder is an independent <b>Front-end</b> Project. I have used HTML and CSS to create the look of the websites. [It is just a front-end]
  Here are the list of Projects and link to preview each one of them:
### Broadway
  > Welcome page for a simple product based website.
### Wine Festival 
  > A simple schedule page of an event.
### Typography

### Paint

### Fashion-blog
  > It is the simplest structure of a blog, made using HTML.
