we see that this got applied to both HTML file's h1 tag so wherever link is present; all h1 tag will turn blue

/* When using just CSS- both ID and classes are same in functionality.
    Though when mixing with some other stuff, Ids are used for identification 
    & classes are used for storing blocks of styling code */
/* DIFFERENCEs */
/* NOTE: you can give same id to different html elements but any element can only have one ID */
/* NOTE: HTML elements can use more than one class; we separate them by a space while using inside a tag*/
/* ID's are meant to be used to identify a specific element in the HTML page; IDs are identifier. */
/* IDs have special attributes with web-browser, like when using JavaScript you can use IDs
     to identify certain elements in your HTML, these IDs could be used by browser to use different things.  */
/* IDs should be used when required for 1-2 elements, not when using a bunch of elements; they're identifiers. */
/* Classes are there when you want to excessively use for many elements; that's what classes are for. */
