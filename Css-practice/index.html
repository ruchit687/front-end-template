<!-- positioning allows you to set the position of the HTML element relative to itself, relative to document,
    or relative to screen, or it could be fixed -->
<!-- In CSS we have 4 basic types of positioning, it could be static,relative,absolute & fixed. -->
<!-- the default positioning in HTML is static; it simply places the elements in same static orders and position;
     static simply means they'll layout the elements as they're layed out in HTML document. -->
<!-- Relative positioning allows you to position an element relative to it's position where it was supposed to be. -->
<!-- so along with relative we use-- top/bottom/left/right: pixels
     static elements can't be overlapped; relative means it can overlappped as we can move it from the position
     where it was supposed to be -->
<!-- Absolute: to be more specific, here the element will position itself relative to the nearest position ancestor.
     In other words, if this element in inside of container. it will position itself relative to that container.
     But otherwise it positions itself relative to the entire document -->
<!-- Fixed, position the element as per the viewport of the website; it is used with again top/bottom/right/left -->
